### Expense Tracker App
### Overview
The Expense Manager App is a web application built with React and Material UI that allows users to manage their personal expenses. Users can add, view, edit, and delete expenses. The app also provides a summary of total expenses and categorizes expenses for better insight into spending habits. Data persistence is handled with Local Storage, making it easy to keep track of expenses between sessions.

### Features
`Add Expenses`: Easily add new expenses with fields for name, amount, and category.\

`View Expenses`: See all expenses in a table format with columns for name, amount, category, and actions.

`Edit and Delete Expenses`: Edit or delete any expense as needed.

`Expense Summary`: View a summary of total expenses and expenses by category.

`Responsive UI`: The app is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience across all device sizes.

`Client-Side Routing`: Navigate between different sections without page reloads.

`Data Persistence`: Expenses are saved in Local Storage, so data is retained even after refreshing the page.

### Technologies Used
`React`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

`Material UI (MUI)`: A React component library for building a responsive, modern UI with ready-to-use components.

`React Router`: For client-side routing to navigate between different views of the app.

`Local Storage`: Used for data persistence, storing user expenses across sessions.

### Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

`Node.js (v12 or higher)`: Download Node.js
`npm`: Comes with Node.js. To check if it’s installed, run npm -v in your terminal.

### Steps
1. `Clone the repository`:
git clone [git@github.com:ARIERICYRON/expense-manager.git]
cd expense-manager

### Install the dependencies:
2. `npm install`


Run the application:

3. `npm start`
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### Usage
`Home`: View a list of all expenses, with options to edit or delete each entry.

`Add Expense`: Navigate to this page to add a new expense. The form includes input fields for the expense name, amount, and category selection.

`Edit Expense`: Accessible from the Home page. Allows editing of an existing expense’s details.

`Summary`: View the total expenses and categorized expenses in a summarized format.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
